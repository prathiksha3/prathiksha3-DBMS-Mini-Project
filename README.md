I worked on developing a Flat Rental Management System, applying various tools and technologies including HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, and XAMPP to create a robust web application. This project was designed to streamline the management of flat rental properties by automating key tasks such as tracking tenants, flats, and payments. The goal was to provide an intuitive platform that would be especially helpful to property owners managing multiple flats. The core functionality of the system involved creating a database that stored essential information about flats, tenants, and their rental payments. For this, I used SQL to design relational tables that ensured data integrity, consistency, and easy retrieval. The structure allowed for storing flat details, tenant profiles, and payment histories in an organized manner. I applied my knowledge of database normalization to reduce redundancy and optimize query performance. On the front end, I utilized HTML and CSS to design a user-friendly interface. The layout was kept clean and straightforward to ensure easy navigation for the property owner, who is the primary user. I used HTML to structure the content and CSS to style the web pages, ensuring that the design was responsive and accessible across various devices. To link the frontend with the backend, I integrated PHP, which served as the core scripting language to process user requests, handle form submissions, and interact with the database. PHP enabled me to create dynamic pages where property owners could view tenant details, update rental payments, and manage flats with ease.
